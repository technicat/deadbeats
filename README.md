# deadbeats

Interestingly, they comprise two categories.

## game publishers and studios
- Fingerprint Play: after I cancelled the app publishing contract due to non-payment they continued publishing on a partner device (Handspring?) and collecting royalties without paying me. I only found out when Handspring asked me to renew the contract. According to the much delayed royalty report, they owe me $20.
- nxTomo Games: brought me to Hong Kong for a contract including a return flight at the end then changed the contract length and refused to pay $50 to reschedule the return flight, said they didn't have the budget for it.
- Papaya Studio: didn't pay my invoice for $9000, said they didn't expect it to be that much, that I was trying to take advantage of them (not the invoice, but from hesitating about taking the contract in the first place which you can see why), and later sent me a a big whiny e-mail saying it was all a misunderstanding and they hadn't expected to pay me at all. Then they sued their next two publishers for non-payment.

## residential
- Liberty Blvd: After dragging out a lease application for a week while I burned cash on hotels and murmuring about requiring me to pay a whole year's rent in advance, I said never mind and they kept $500 of deposit (and only returned the amount above it after I called about it three weeks later and wrote an angry review).
- Domain: They reserve the right to increase the security deposit apparently even the night before move-in after taking the maximum reservation period to approve the application. When I said never mind, they said what if we don't increase it? When I said now I really don't want to move in, they said well you're not getting any of it back, totalling around $300.
- Centre Pointe: deducted prorated final month rent, around $200, from my deposit even though I already paid that rent. Also they gave away my parking spot before I moved out.
- Carma Corp: after selling my condo and submitting a move-out notice confirmed by Priority Meter, they were acquired by Carma Corp who continued taking money out of my bank account without advanced notice or even listing the withdrawal authorization in their new online account, so I had to call customer service who told me I had to send a copy of the sale deed to my former HOA and have them notify Carma, which is idiotic, the sale is a matter of public record and everyone including the HOA and city services stopped billing me when the sale closed. Nine months later they still haven't refunded the $20 they shouldn't have taken out in the first place. How about a late payment fee?
- Landlord let's call him MP, didn't want to withhold a few hundred dollars from my deposit to pay for a fee the management company charged him (I rented from the management company to avoid things like this. Also it was run by a racist. And it was in Jersey City.)
- Roommate asked me to cover his move-in cost (first and last month rent, this being Boston area), then next month rent, rent then acted surprised when I didn't continue paying and the landlord sent us eviction notices. He didn't pay me back and the landlord didn't return my last month rent.
- California utility (PG&E?): had a one cent balance due to me on my account after I moved and kept sending me a bilpel showing that balance. I called about it and they just zeroed out the account and kept the penny.
